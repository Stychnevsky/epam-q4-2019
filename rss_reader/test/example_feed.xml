More than 700 areas in greater Jakarta region suffered from power outages, according to state-run electricity company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara.

They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat,&amp;quot; he wrote on Twitter. &amp;quot;The US Embassy in Iraq is, &amp; has been for hours, SAFE! Many of our great Warfighters, together with the most lethal military equipment in the world, was immediately rushed to the site.&amp;quot; Mr Trump  intensified pressure on the Iraqi authorities who had been powerless to prevent hundreds of demonstrators breaching the outer wall of the embassy compound in the heavily fortified green zone. He pressed the case for action in a call to  Iraq&amp;#39;s caretaker  Prime Minister Adel Abd al-Mahd, urging him to protect US personnel and property. Asked later in the day about the possibility of tensions spiraling into a war with Iran, Mr Trump told reporters: &amp;quot;Do I want to? No. I want to have peace. I like peace. And Iran should want to have peace more than anybody. So I don&amp;#39;t see that happening.&amp;quot; Chanting &amp;quot;death to America&amp;quot;, the protesters set fire to a sentry box, pulled security cameras away from walls and hurled a barrage of missiles including Molotov cocktails. At one point the mob, which was protesting against US airstrikes on an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq on Sunday, used a drainpipe in an attempt to smash an embassy window. US troops tried to disperse the crowd firing warning shots before using teargas and stun grenades.  At least 62 people were reported to have been injured. Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 31 December 2019 Amid mounting tension, the US announced it would be deploying additional marines to increase security. Two Apache helicopters flew over the compound in a show of force. Matt Tueller, the US ambassador in Iraq, was not in the embassy at the time, but will be returning to join staff in the compound, the US State Department said. Under pressure from Mr Trump to protect US personnel, Mr Mahdi  had deployed special forces at the main gate in an attempt to prevent hundreds of protesters forcing their way in. Some of the crowd did withdraw, while others pitched tents, paving the way for a siege, which a spokesman for the militant group said would remain until US diplomats leave the country. As the violence unfolded in Iraq, Mr Trump intensified pressure on both Iraq and Iran with a series of tweets. &amp;quot;We expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!&amp;quot; Mr Trump tweeted, saying Iran &amp;quot;will be held fully responsible&amp;quot; for the unrest. Mr Trump was unapologetic for the military action which killed at least 25 fighters from Iran-backed Kataeb Hezbollah, a militant group with the US holds responsible for the death of an American contractor. &amp;quot;Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many.

In response, Tehran accused the US of &amp;quot;audacity&amp;quot; in blaming Iran for the demonstrations. &amp;quot;The surprising audacity of American officials is so much that after killing at least 25... and violating the country&amp;#39;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, that now... they attribute the Iraqi people&amp;#39;s protest against their cruel acts to the Islamic Republic of Iran,&amp;quot; said foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi. In the US, Republican hawks praised Mr Trump&amp;#39;s tough response to the attack on the embassy. &amp;quot;He has put the world on notice - there will be no Benghazi&amp;#39;s on his watch,&amp;quot; tweeted Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally and GOP senator from South Carolina. Newt Gingrich called for even tougher action. &amp;quot;The United States should respond to Iran in Iran. The Iranian dictatorship doesn&amp;#39;t care how many of its allies we hit in Iraq.

Biden, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Buttigieg, a veteran of the Afghanistan war, have each sought to make cogent commander-in-chief cases on the campaign trail—hardly ever at each other’s expense. But with just over a month until caucusing commences, the unpredictability of the political cycle has turned the notion of an inevitable winner upside down, with two of the leading contenders—a 77-year-old established politician and a 37-year-old Beltway neophyte—now on a collision course over one of their most powerful shared interests. The two men have markedly different approaches to highlighting contrasts with their rivals. Biden, who has reliably topped national polls since launching his campaign in April, tends to employ a simple approach: Stay (mostly) out of the fray; attack (mostly) only when attacked; and try, with varying degrees of success, to stick to the script.Biden Sneers at Millennials, and Vice VersaButtigieg, whose final term as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, officially ends at noon on Wednesday, prefers the opposite. When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) hesitated for weeks to release financial details of her health care proposal, for example, the mayor made sure to note that resistance during a televised debate in front of millions of viewers. When Warren hit back in a subsequent event for Buttigieg’s frequent appearance at high-dollar fundraisers, he reminded viewers she’s the “wealthy person”—not him. Now, with the two moderate Democrats just three percentage points away from each other in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two early voting states that tee off the nominating contest in mere weeks, Buttigieg has gone on a rare offensive against Biden. The mayor has criticized the former senator’s Iraq War vote—a favorite line of attack from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who was opposed to the effort—and changed his tone on Biden’s son Hunter, who has been the subject of a coordinated misinformation campaign from President Donald Trump. “As I’ve said before, I don’t think it’s a smart strategy because those who have gone after the VP on the Democratic side have not lived politically to tell about it,” Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist familiar with Biden’s early state operation in the South, told The Daily Beast. One person directly familiar with Biden’s thinking framed it more broadly. “The closer you get to voting, the more pot shots you take,” the insider said. “He’s seen his numbers go down. We’ve seen this with [Sen. Kamala] Harris up and down, Warren up and down, and Buttigieg. Campaigns and candidates at some point kind of can’t help themselves.”The insider’s comments were made in reference to Buttigieg calling the Iraq War the “worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime” in an interview with Iowa Public Television on Sunday. “I certainly respect the vice president, but this is an example of why years in Washington is not always the same thing as judgment,” Buttigieg said. Buttigieg, who unlike Sanders did not say the vote was disqualifying, is unlikely to make Biden’s Iraq War stance a focus of his offensive strategy but rather one data point in a larger thread of contrast among multiple contenders. Indeed, the Buttigieg campaign is more keen to double down on the previous line of contrast that’s he’s been discussing publicly for months: that “Washington experience” isn’t the only type of relevant work history necessary to become president and that judgment is informed by many different personal and professional paths. That theme is so well known that one campaign adviser affiliated with a separate rival candidate acknowledged strategizing around Buttigieg’s potential to bring up his military experience at some point on the debate stage.“He had telegraphed this was going to be his set,” the source said.In an interview on Monday, the mayor also weighed in on an issue that has infuriated Team Biden for months: his son Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine. When asked by the Associated Press how Buttigieg would have handled a hypothetical politically delicate situation similar to Biden’s, he said he would have taken a different approach.“I would not have wanted to see that happen,” Buttigieg said, in reference to Hunter serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father served as vice president. A moment later, Buttigieg reiterated previous remarks that the line of questioning is nothing more than a distraction. “At the same time, again, I think this is being used to divert attention from what’s really at stake in the impeachment process. There’s been no allegation, let alone finding of any kind of wrongdoing,” he said. Still, Buttigieg’s criticism is a change in posture for the Indiana Democrat, who has defended the former vice president’s son in the face of an onslaught of harassment from Trump.In an October appearance on CNN’s State of the Union, Buttigieg lauded Hunter Biden’s decision to step down from the board of a Chinese private equity company, citing it as an improvement on the Trump administration’s embrace of nepotism.“I think it demonstrates the difference in standards relative to the White House,” Buttigieg said at the time. “I mean, here you have Hunter Biden stepping down from a position in order to make sure, even though there’s been no accusation of wrongdoing, doing something just to make sure there’s not even the appearance of a conflict of interest. While, in the White House, the president of the United States is a walking conflict of interest.”That same month, Buttigieg dodged a question from the Washington Examiner about whether he would allow his own child to serve on the board of a foreign company, calling the issue a “shiny object” intended to divide the Democratic Party and deflect from the president’s own actions.“One thing that is really important right now is to deny this president [the opportunity] to change the subject, and the subject is that the president confessed on national television to an abuse of power,” Buttigieg said at the time. “Let’s deal with that and not get caught in the shiny objects he’s going to throw out.”The change of tone now matches the frenetic nature of the Democratic primary cycle, multiple campaign insiders and outside strategists said, when several candidates all competing for momentum in the first few early voting states throw out new lines of contrast in an effort to maximize attention.This week’s remarks were not the first time Buttigieg signaled differences with Biden over foreign policy. In June, The Daily Beast reported early signs of the mayor quietly moving in on one of Biden’s top issues: America’s standing on the world stage. During competing campaign events on the same day, both Democrats used the word “existential” when discussing matters of national security, both arguing that the fundamental principle of democracy was under attack by Trump and highlighting parts of their own records to put the country back on track. Mayor Pete Buttigieg Quietly Moves in on Joe Biden’s Top IssueSpokespeople from Biden’s and Buttigieg’s campaigns declined to comment on the record for this story. But as the Feb. 3 Iowa caucus approaches, Democratic strategists eagerly gamed out the polling implications of reigniting such contrasts again now. “A well-run campaign, which we have every reason to believe Buttigieg’s is, wouldn’t be attacking Biden unless their internal data showed it was necessary,” one Democratic strategist said. “Likewise, they would only use a message that quantitative or qualitative data showed had a chance at success.”The latest Real Clear Politics polling average reveals a hefty gap between Biden and Buttigieg’s standing nationally. The former vice president has a commanding 20-point lead over Buttigieg, earing 28.4 percent of support to the mayor’s 8.2 percent. In the early states, the space between the two aspirants is much narrower. In Iowa, where Buttigieg has surged in recent months, he tops polling averages at 22 percent. But Biden, who has focused the majority of his campaign strategy on winning more diverse areas, including South Carolina, is just behind Buttigieg at 18.8 percent, following an eight-day, 18-county bus tour there. In New Hampshire, it’s a similar story. Buttigieg is approximately three points ahead of Biden there, earning 17.7 percent of support to the former vice president’s 14.3 percent. Both of them trail Sanders, with 19 percent.“I think Pete is worried he will lose voters to Biden,” Liz Mair, a veteran Republican campaign operative, said simply. Still, other seasoned political hands offered a more optimistic end result for Buttigieg, who one former top campaign aide to Hillary Clinton said “isn’t afraid to go on offense,” suggesting that’s a strategic advantage in a matchup against Trump. “The difference between what we are seeing from him and have seen from others in the past is that if he isn’t the nominee, he will be at the front of the line to unite the party,” the former Clinton aide said.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Han demonstrated that he could accomplish that physical feat, but appears to have lost further ground in the fight for Taiwan’s top office.Going into 2019, Han was riding high. His unlikely come-from-behind victory in the race for mayor of Kaohsiung -- Taiwan’s third-largest city -- immediately made him a top contender to unseat incumbent Tsai Ing-wen in the Jan. 11, 2020, presidential election.He was the talk of Chinese-speaking communities from Singapore to New York. Driven by the passionate backing of a sizable group of supporters made up largely of retirees, he polled at 54% in February, 29 percentage points ahead of Tsai, according to a TVBS survey.Since then, the race has seen a turnaround, with all major polls showing Tsai holding a lead of around 20 percentage points over Han. Her resurgence has been fueled by a resilient economy and stock market, an effective campaign and sometimes violent protests over China’s grip in neighboring Hong Kong, which have confronted Taiwanese voters with the potential perils of closer ties with Beijing.While Tsai enjoys a strong lead, her victory is by no means assured. Her supporters are largely made up of Taiwanese between the ages of 20 and 40, a demographic less likely to turn out than the older voters who predominantly back Han. And recent opinion surveys may overestimate Tsai’s lead, after Han urged his followers to undermine them by claiming to support Tsai if contacted by pollsters.In the end, turnout is likely to be the deciding factor for whether Han can translate the ardent support of his smaller cadre of die-hard supporters into victory over Tsai’s broader -- but less motivated -- base.Fresh DoubtStill, Han’s talk show appearance was the latest in a series of gaffes and bizarre comments that have, for some voters, cast doubt on his viability. His performance as mayor has done little to overcome the public’s skepticism.A video that showed him struggling to answer city councilors’ questions about Kaohsiung went viral in May. He’s also the subject of a local recall motion after upending a vow to see out his term as mayor mere months before launching a presidential campaign.“Han is a populist. Populists usually claim to implement some huge policies that will bring about immediate effect to help the economy,” said Austin Wang, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Nevada. “However, Han has failed to implement any of the important policies he promised in Kaohsiung, such as the Ferris Wheel, drilling in the South China Sea or bringing Disneyland to Kaohsiung.”While Han’s emotional, shoot-from-the-hip rhetorical style is one of the reasons he engenders such passion among his supporters, it has driven others away. He was accused of misogyny in October when he spoke disparagingly about Tsai’s weight and complexion, calling her “pale-skinned and fat” -- the implication being that she shunned hard work.He also came under fire from Manila’s top representative to Taiwan in March after using a racially derogatory term while questioning whether Taiwanese parents could accept teachers from the Philippines teaching their children, and denigrating other immigrants to the island.China ChallengeHan’s main challenge, as the talk show appearance signaled, has been articulating a clear policy on relations with the mainland.Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party supports independence, has vowed that Taiwan will never be unified with China as long she is in power. Han, on the other hand, has struggled to find a consistent message.In recent months, Han has repeated, sometimes reading directly from a written statement, that he thinks the 1992 Consensus -- a vague agreement stipulating that both sides of the Taiwan strait are part of China -- is the best way forward for Taiwan. When pressed for greater detail, he has either repeated the statement word for word or launched into an unrelated story.In an interview with Bloomberg News in November, Han warned Taiwan against testing Beijing’s “red line” by pushing independence.Democracy Would Solve Hong Kong Problems, Taiwan Contender Says“If the 23 million people of Taiwan came to a consensus and voted for independence in a referendum, they would have to deal with the military and political consequences,” Han said. “You can’t avoid it.

Han demonstrated that he could accomplish that physical feat, but appears to have lost further ground in the fight for Taiwan’s top office.Going into 2019, Han was riding high. His unlikely come-from-behind victory in the race for mayor of Kaohsiung -- Taiwan’s third-largest city -- immediately made him a top contender to unseat incumbent Tsai Ing-wen in the Jan. 11, 2020, presidential election.He was the talk of Chinese-speaking communities from Singapore to New York. Driven by the passionate backing of a sizable group of supporters made up largely of retirees, he polled at 54% in February, 29 percentage points ahead of Tsai, according to a TVBS survey.Since then, the race has seen a turnaround, with all major polls showing Tsai holding a lead of around 20 percentage points over Han. Her resurgence has been fueled by a resilient economy and stock market, an effective campaign and sometimes violent protests over China’s grip in neighboring Hong Kong, which have confronted Taiwanese voters with the potential perils of closer ties with Beijing.While Tsai enjoys a strong lead, her victory is by no means assured. Her supporters are largely made up of Taiwanese between the ages of 20 and 40, a demographic less likely to turn out than the older voters who predominantly back Han. And recent opinion surveys may overestimate Tsai’s lead, after Han urged his followers to undermine them by claiming to support Tsai if contacted by pollsters.In the end, turnout is likely to be the deciding factor for whether Han can translate the ardent support of his smaller cadre of die-hard supporters into victory over Tsai’s broader -- but less motivated -- base.Fresh DoubtStill, Han’s talk show appearance was the latest in a series of gaffes and bizarre comments that have, for some voters, cast doubt on his viability. His performance as mayor has done little to overcome the public’s skepticism.A video that showed him struggling to answer city councilors’ questions about Kaohsiung went viral in May. He’s also the subject of a local recall motion after upending a vow to see out his term as mayor mere months before launching a presidential campaign.“Han is a populist. Populists usually claim to implement some huge policies that will bring about immediate effect to help the economy,” said Austin Wang, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Nevada. “However, Han has failed to implement any of the important policies he promised in Kaohsiung, such as the Ferris Wheel, drilling in the South China Sea or bringing Disneyland to Kaohsiung.”While Han’s emotional, shoot-from-the-hip rhetorical style is one of the reasons he engenders such passion among his supporters, it has driven others away. He was accused of misogyny in October when he spoke disparagingly about Tsai’s weight and complexion, calling her “pale-skinned and fat” -- the implication being that she shunned hard work.He also came under fire from Manila’s top representative to Taiwan in March after using a racially derogatory term while questioning whether Taiwanese parents could accept teachers from the Philippines teaching their children, and denigrating other immigrants to the island.China ChallengeHan’s main challenge, as the talk show appearance signaled, has been articulating a clear policy on relations with the mainland.Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party supports independence, has vowed that Taiwan will never be unified with China as long she is in power. Han, on the other hand, has struggled to find a consistent message.In recent months, Han has repeated, sometimes reading directly from a written statement, that he thinks the 1992 Consensus -- a vague agreement stipulating that both sides of the Taiwan strait are part of China -- is the best way forward for Taiwan. When pressed for greater detail, he has either repeated the statement word for word or launched into an unrelated story.In an interview with Bloomberg News in November, Han warned Taiwan against testing Beijing’s “red line” by pushing independence.Democracy Would Solve Hong Kong Problems, Taiwan Contender Says“If the 23 million people of Taiwan came to a consensus and voted for independence in a referendum, they would have to deal with the military and political consequences,” Han said. “You can’t avoid it. We don’t have any resources. We have nothing.”In March, Han traveled to Hong Kong and held a closed-door meeting with China’s powerful Liaison Office in the city, a summit that elicited a warning from the Mainland Affairs Council about the political sensitivity of entering the office to meet with Chinese officials.

Donald Trump carried the state in 2016, but Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, won in 2016, by just over 10,000 votes.This week’s ruling was a blow to state Republicans, who overrode a veto from Cooper to enact the law last year. The measure came two years after North Carolina’s previous voter ID law was struck down as part of a host of voting restrictions a federal appeals court said targeted African Americans “with almost surgical precision”. African Americans make up about one-fifth of registered voters in North Carolina. Turnout among African Americans dropped six percentage points from 2012 to 2016.Voters approved a constitutional amendment to require voter photo ID in 2018. But the new voter ID law, Biggs wrote Tuesday, didn’t fix the discrimination present in the old one. She noted many of the same lawmakers pushed the new law and had openly said it was designed not to fix discriminatory issues, but to survive further legal challenge.“The legislature sought ways to circumvent state and federal courts and further entrench itself,” she wrote.This iteration of the North Carolina law required voters to present one of 10 forms of acceptable identification, such as a driver’s license, passport, or military ID in order to vote. But Biggs noted that minority voters in the state were less likely to possess an acceptable form of ID. She also noted that African American voters were more likely to have public assistance and military IDs – both of which were not considered an acceptable form of voter ID under the law.“The evidence suggests that minority voters are not just less likely to have an acceptable form of ID, but that the legislature excluded photographic ID that could have greatly reduced that discrepancy,” she wrote.Biggs also appeared unconvinced that certain provisions in the law would mitigate the impact on black voters. While the law provides free ID to anyone who cannot afford one, she noted that those who need ID might not be able to spare the time to travel to the DMV to get one, even if it was free. She also wrote that a provision allowing people to vote if they swore they could not get ID could lead to confusion among poll workers.In addition to blocking the voter ID measure on Tuesday, Biggs also stopped a provision in the law that allowed poll watchers to challenge someone’s ballot if they did not have acceptable photo ID. She ordered state election officials to publicize that voter ID would not be needed to vote in the state until she issued a further ruling.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/federal-judge-blocks-north-carolinas-130004562.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 08:00:04 -0500</pubDate><source url="https://www.theguardian.com/international">The Guardian</source><guid isPermaLink="false">federal-judge-blocks-north-carolinas-130004562.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gIQALVyrK0raY54sdqqVKA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/62149f4dda2837f50b1d8d29e5538d1f" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/federal-judge-blocks-north-carolinas-130004562.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gIQALVyrK0raY54sdqqVKA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/62149f4dda2837f50b1d8d29e5538d1f" width="130" height="86" alt="Federal judge blocks North Carolina&amp;#39;s voter ID law, citing its discriminatory intent" align="left" title="Federal judge blocks North Carolina&amp;#39;s voter ID law, citing its discriminatory intent" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;The decision could have a big impact in a state that is key to the 2020 presidential electionA federal judge formally blocked North Carolina’s new voter identification law on Tuesday, ruling that discriminatory intent was likely a motivating factor in how the measure was crafted.The decision from US district judge Loretta Biggs could have big consequences in North Carolina, a key state in the 2020 presidential election that is scheduled to hold its presidential primary on 3 March.

Now newly released interview transcripts show McCabe expressed remorse to internal FBI investigators when they pressed him on the about-face. The FBI released the documents in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). They provide fresh details about the investigation into a leak to the Journal, McCabe&amp;#39;s role in it, and the reaction of agents who investigated it.In the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, the Journal broke news about an FBI investigation involving then-candidate Hillary Clinton, describing internal discussions among senior FBI officials.Emails Show McCabe Scrambling to Handle Stories About Hillary ProbeThe apparent leak drew scrutiny from the bureau’s internal investigation team, which interviewed McCabe on May 9, 2017, the day President Donald Trump fired James Comey from his post as FBI director. The agents interviewed him as part of an investigation regarding a different media leak to the online publication Circa, and also asked him about the Journal story. In that interview, McCabe said he did not know how the Journal story came to be. But a few months later, his story changed after he reviewed his answer. On Aug. 18, FBI officials met with McCabe in an attempt to work through what they said was “conflicting information” they had gathered about the possible leak to the Journal.“I need to know from you,” an agent said he told McCabe in a sit-down meeting, “did you authorize this article? Were you aware of it? Did you authorize it?” McCabe then looked at the story he had reviewed months earlier. The FBI investigator described his response this way: “And as nice as could be, he said, yep. Yep I did.”Ex-FBI Head Andrew McCabe Sues, Says Trump Ordered His FiringThe investigator then said that “things had suddenly changed 180 degrees with this.” The interviewers stopped taking notes on what McCabe was saying, and the agent indicated their view of McCabe had changed: He was no longer a witness or victim. “In our business, we stop and say, look, now we’re getting into an area for due process,” the agent said.But the agent said that the team did not raise that line of thought with McCabe. “I was very careful to say… with all due respect, this is what you told us. This has caused us some kind of, you know, sidetracking here now with some information other people have told us.”The agent’s next comments to McCabe took on a frustrated tone.“I remember saying to him, at, I said, sir, you understand that we’ve put a lot of work into this based on what you told us,” the agent said. “I mean, and I even said, long nights and weekends working on this, trying to find out who amongst your ranks of trusted people would, would do something like that. And he kind of just looked down, kind of nodded, and said yeah I’m sorry.”McCabe’s lawyer has said his story changed because in the initial interview he wasn’t prepared for the question. The question surprised him, and he didn’t give his answer a second thought because Comey was fired shortly after the interview concluded and his world turned upside down. McCabe, who became acting director of the FBI after Trump fired Comey, was fired in March 2018, two days before he was expected to retire. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was axing McCabe because of the leak investigation’s findings. McCabe, who had been assailed by Trump over and over again on Twitter over the Russia investigation, denied wrongdoing and alleged his firing was politically motivated. In August, he sued DOJ for wrongful termination and has since accused the Trump administration of withholding evidence that would help his case.The DOJ Inspector General, meanwhile, later accused McCabe of lying to investigators multiple times. After that report came out, McCabe’s lawyer said it was “far less fair than he deserved,” and “utterly failed to support the decision to terminate Mr. McCabe.” Lying to federal investigators is a crime, and the Inspector General referred its investigation of McCabe to the U.S. Attorney’s office for Washington D.C. McCabe has not been charged with any crime––despite numerous Trump tweets calling him a criminal. Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

EU diplomats, mediating in both cases, may feel they’re making headway in easing tensions more than five years after the conflict in eastern Ukraine rekindled Cold War animosity and brought a barrage of sanctions against Russia.That Ukraine and Russia now meet at all -- let alone reach consensus on hot-button issues like these -- marks undoubted progress. It’s been driven by pragmatism and a readiness to compromise under EU and U.S. pressure, including the Trump administration’s sanctions against Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project.The gas deal was necessary as transit contracts ran down. Putin wants sanctions relief and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has prioritized ending a war that’s killed more than 13,000 people.The fundamental question -- whether Ukraine leans east or west -- is going nowhere without concessions regarded as impossible by one side or another. The standoff with Moscow over Ukraine’s desire to join the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will remain a headache for world powers from Brussels to Washington.“The events of the past several years have created significant changes in how the two governments and their people relate to one another, and to the rest of Europe,” said Alex Brideau, an analyst at Eurasia Group. “Recent developments help ease tension, but they don’t reset that relationship.”Ensure FlowsThe EU will nevertheless breathe a sigh of relief after the accord was signed to ensure flows of gas through Ukraine from Russia’s Gazprom for the next five years. Supplies to the region have been cut twice during in the past 13 years at times of peak demand because of financial and political disputes between the two neighboring states.Russia, keen to take advantage of French President Emmanuel Macron’s push to reintegrate it after years of isolation, has less incentive to cause mayhem this time. But it retains its long-term goal of seeking to slash dependence on Ukraine’s transit network.That Russia agreed to a longer-than-expected gas deal this time reflects potential fallout from the U.S. sanctioning its Nord Stream 2 pipeline to send flows directly to Europe bypassing Ukraine rather than any act of kindness. For Zelenskiy, it ensures Ukraine remains one of the key transit routes for Russian gas during the remainder of his five-year term and beyond, earning the country billions of dollars in fees.Still, the fact an initial deadline to finalize the deal was missed stems from a lack of trust that prompted demands for safeguards to be added to the new contracts.Prisoner DealThere are similar reasons to scrutinize the exchange of prisoners.Despite efforts to return all his countrymen, Zelenskiy remains frustrated, with hundreds still being held.What’s more, the latest swap included Ukrainian riot police who sided with the Kremlin-backed leader that protesters toppled in 2014 after more than 100 were killed on the streets of Kyiv. Handing over those officers, who aren’t prisoners of war, prompted demonstrations against their release back home.The gas agreement and the prisoner swap cap a month in which Putin and Zelenskiy held their first face-to-face meeting during talks on the conflict in eastern Ukraine in Paris. While the detente remains fragile, the two sides enter 2020 with potentially the best prospects in years for easing tensions.Putin and Zelenskiy spoke by phone on Tuesday and agreed to coordinate lists of detainees for possible future exchanges, according to a statement from the Ukrainian president’s office. The gas agreement creates a “favorable atmosphere for resolving other bilateral problems” and the Dec. 29 prisoner swap “helps strengthen mutual trust,” the Kremlin said in a statement.There may be more prisoner exchanges, though “I do not think we will see real compromises on big issues” from Russia in relation to resolving the conflict, said John Herbst, director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.To contact the reporters on this story: Daryna Krasnolutska in Kyiv at dkrasnolutsk@bloomberg.net;Andrew Langley in London at alangley1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrea Dudik at adudik@bloomberg.net, Tony Halpin, Gregory L.
